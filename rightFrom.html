Hi iframe

The mood in the Indian camp is good. Batsmen bounced back and led India to a win in Kolkata, after the disaster against New Zealand in Nagpur. But in both games, bowling surely deserves praise. After all, they helped restrict opponents to modest totals. That India chased one down, but not the other, is another matter. The hype has largely been around batsmen, but bowlers seem to be doing well too
